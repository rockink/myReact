# myReact
My first react redux thingy. It felt good while making it work. It has least possible content for easy understanding, and a kind of boilerplate to move things here and there and start from it.

*Give it a shot

If you have any questions, let me know. I will help to the fullest trying to make you guys understand what I have learnt. Its not complete, but it gives confidence to start something!
